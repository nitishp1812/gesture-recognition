# Gesture Recognition

Trained a neural network to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using Keras and OpenCV.

## ASL Gesture Recognition

Built and trained a convolutional neural network for the recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. The network was trained on a Kaggle dataset of ASL gestures uploaded by Ayush Thakur.
The model attained a 57% accuracy on a test set extracted from the dataset.

To improve this accuracy, I will be experimenting with different model architectures and datasets from
Kaggle.

Moreover, the model was not able to completely recognize the hand in bright lighting conditions.
I will also be trying out different feature extraction algorithms in OpenCV to get better results.

## Run

To run the code install the requirements with python3.

Then run ```python3 main.py```

This opens the prediction engine. The results are not very good, especially in bright lighting conditions.
