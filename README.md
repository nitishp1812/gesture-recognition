# Gesture Recognition

Trained a neural network to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using Keras and OpenCV.

## ASL Gesture Recognition

Built and trained a convolutional neural network for the recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. The network was trained on a Kaggle dataset of ASL gestures uploaded by Ayush Thakur.

The model attained a 57% accuracy on a test set extracted from the dataset.

## Run

To run the code install the requirements with python 3 by 

 ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this, the tool can be run with ```python main.py```

The results of the engine are displayed in the application window.
